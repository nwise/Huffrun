    <p><img height="129" align="right" width="297" style="padding-left: 10px;" src="/files/Image/septic_tank_diagram3.JPG" alt="" />Fecal coliform levels are above Ohio EPA&rsquo;s primary contact standard in parts of Huff Run and its tributaries as measured by County Health Departments.<br />
    <br />
    Failing septic systems have been identified as a concern affecting water quality within Huff Run as well as an out dated sewer system in Mineral City. Many rounds of bacteriological sampling have been conducted along Huff Run and its major tributaries. Most test results were positive for E-coli and high levels of fecal coliform, chemical biological oxygen demand (CBOD) and ammonia. <br />
    <br />
    Many human health risks can be attributed to improper sewage disposal. Raw sewage contains various pathogens that are easily transmitted through open waterways. This is a particular concern in the recreational areas in Huff Run. The Jerry Shuman Ball fields and the Mineral City Park both have tributaries running right along them that are affected.&nbsp; Individuals coming into contact with contaminated water can contract illnesses such as typhoid, tuberculosis, dysentery, cholera, tetanus, hepatitis, and several types of gastroenteritis. Several types of internal parasites are also present in sewage, along with a number of fungal diseases.<br />
    Also, the health of aquatic species can be adversely impacted leaving them vulnerable to disease after coming in contact with fecal coliform.</p>

    <p><img height="162" align="right" width="200" src="/files/Image/trash2.JPG" style="padding-left: 10px;" alt="" />Illegal dumping in the watershed within isolated forested areas, along roads and within unreclaimed strip pits is a problem.</p>
    <p>Trash disposal fees are too high for low-income residents to dispose of major items (especially for tires and large appliances). Communities and individuals are uninformed about alternatives to and the effects of illegal dumping.</p>
    <p>Harmful impacts to the watershed and water quality from illegally dumped trash include: debris jams which increase the impacts of flooding, surface water contamination from dump site runoff containing chemicals, and significant health risks. Some health risks include: injury due to sharp objects, increase in rodents, the potential spread of diseases (West Nile Virus, encephalitis and Dengue Fever) from mosquito breeding in scrap tires. Perhaps the most important component of the illegal trash dumping problem is the continued lack of respect for the environment and how that can affect future economic development in the area. Economic impacts caused by illegal trash dumping include: decreased property values because communities become unattractive, and increased cost because of government clean-up expenditures leading to higher local, state, and federal taxes.</p>

    <h2><font color="#000080">What is a Watershed?</font></h2>
    <p>A watershed is an area of land surrounding and &ldquo;shedding&rdquo; water into a stream, lake, river or wetland. When it rains, all the run off flows into this common area. In fact, all the surface water (smaller streams, ponds, lakes) is related to this larger water body. They all affect its water quality.</p>
    <p>All land is part of a watershed. If you live in the Huff Run Watershed, your actions affect Huff Run but also affect other bodies of water that you might not think about. The water that flows into Huff Run, flows into the Conotton Creek which in turn runs into the Tuscarawas River. The Tusc flows into the Muskingum River and on to the Ohio River. The Ohio dumps into the Mississippi and then into the Gulf of Mexico. This is why the HRWRP takes the watershed approach to cleaning up the Huff Run.</p>

In fact, all the surface water (smaller streams, ponds, lakes) is related to this larger water body. They all affect its water quality.</p>
    <p>All land is part of a watershed. If you live in the Huff Run Watershed, your actions affect Huff Run but also affect other bodies of water that you might not think about. The water that flows into Huff Run, flows into the Conotton Creek which in turn runs into the Tuscarawas River. The Tusc flows into the Muskingum River and on to the Ohio River. The Ohio dumps into the Mississippi and then into the Gulf of Mexico. This is why the HRWRP takes the watershed approach to cleaning up the Huff Run.</p>

    <h2><font color="#000080">Huff Run History</font></h2>
    <h3><font color="#333399">Godfrey Huff</font></h3>
    <p>The first recognized settler of Sandy Township was Godfrey Huff, who Huff Run was named after. Records show that he was from Bedford County, Pennsylvania. In May 1805, he purchased a tract of 1,000 acres in the southwest corner of the third quarter of Township 10, Range 1, or the southwest corner of Sandy Township, embracing also the corner of Lawrence across the river from Godfrey Haga, for $1,062.50. Old settlers have assigned the year 1803 as the date of his emigration to this tract, but historical societies have found evidence that he was here in 1801. Mr. Huff was a man of large frame, and wore the broad-brimmed hat and the garb of the Dunkard sect, of which he was a member. He is said to have raised many hogs on the river bottoms, driven them to Detroit, Michigan for sale, and used the proceeds to pay for his land. He had five sons--Michael, Henry, Samuel, Frederick and Andrew. Most of the boys subsequently emigrated to Iowa. Godfrey Huff died in Sandy Township about 1825.</p>

    <h3><font color="#333399">Huff Run Watershed Restoration Partnership</font></h3>
    <p>The Huff Run Watershed Restoration Partnership (HRWRP) was formed during a meeting on August 15, 1996. A group of government agencies including the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Mineral Resources Management (then, Division of Mine Reclamation), the Office of Surface Mining, Crossroads RC&amp;D and the Ohio EPA. Many citizens stepped forward to become advocates for the stream and wildlife in the area. The Partnership was formed with the leadership and passion of these local people. By 1997, the group began meeting monthly. Shortly after, they established bylaws, filed for a 501&copy;3, created a mission statement and became incorporated. To educate the community, the group has organized field trips for students since 1997. The Huff Run AMDAT was completed early on as well as the first edition of their watershed plan.&nbsp; A full time Coordinator was hired in 2000 &ndash; the same year that Farr, the first passive treatment system in the watershed, was under construction.&nbsp; Since, the group has grown in size and has added VISTA volunteers, AmeriCorps members and interns to their staff.&nbsp; Numerous restoration projects have been completed because of this catalyst group with plans for many more. Huff Run&rsquo;s updated watershed plan was endorsed by the state of Ohio in 2005. Also, in 2005, Rural Action became the HRWRP&rsquo;s fiscal sponsor.</p>

    <h2><font color="#000080">Acid Mine Drainage</font></h2>
    <p><img height="225" align="right" width="300" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px;" src="/files/Image/hr42.JPG" />Acid mine drainage (AMD) is water polluted by deep mining, surface mining, or abandoned coal refuse piles (commonly referred to as gob piles). This water is often orange in color and is usually acidic (but may be alkaline) with high levels of dissolved metals. Large concentrations of iron make the water orange which is the primary metal in the AMD in Huff Run. Aluminum can make the water white in color. Manganese causes a black hue. All of these toxic metals are found in pyrite, a material found in coal. When water and air mix with pyrite a chemical reaction occurs creating AMD.</p>
    <p>AMD degrades habitat allowing the survival of only the most pollution tolerant aquatic species. The precipitation coats the bottom of streams, clogging the habitat of aquatic insects and spawning areas for fish. It can also coal the gills and eggs of aquatic life, rendering the stream lifeless. In groundwater, high mineralization from AMD makes the water supply source unpotable. 
    <p>Wildlife habitat within the Huff Run Watershed has been severely impacted by previous surface mining activities as well as aquatic. Indigenous terrestrial species have been subjected to the loss of significant amounts of habitat as a result. Reclaimed areas, although providing some cover, have been converted from forested to grasslands, creating an alternate prairie like habitat which is not its original form. Significant positive impacts on local populations of wildlife could be achieved if reclamation and reforestation projects would be implemented. Restoring unreclaimed areas to their approximate original contour and establishing vegetation would provide wildlife habitat. In addition, reforestation of reclaimed grasslands would provide much needed quality habitat for wildlife indigenous to the region&rsquo;s forested areas.</p>
    <p>The environmental quality of the forested areas has been severely impacted by the unreclaimed surface mines and discarded tailings from deep mines. The unreclaimed areas have open highwalls, pit impoundment, exposed gob and spoil ridges. Many of the exposed gob and spoil ridges lack vegetation due to acid soil conditions and/or inadequate topsoil. These areas can be reclaimed to the approximate original contour and planted in trees and grasses enhancing wildlife habitat. In some areas vegetation has reestablished overly successful populations of opportunistic plant species. Here, species such as wild grape inhibit the growth of a diverse woodland plant community.</p>

    h1. Goldberg Setup
    
    This is where you will find all the Goldberg-specific administration and configuration features.  In here you can:
    
    * Set up Users.
    
    * Manage Roles and their Permissions.
    
    * Set up any Controllers and their Actions for your application.
    
    * Edit the Content Pages of the site.
    
    * Adjust Goldberg's system settings.
    
    
    h2. Users
    
    You can set up Users with a username, password and a Role.
    
    
    h2. Roles and Permissions
    
    A User's Permissions affect what Actions they can perform and what Pages they can see.  And because each Menu Item is based either on a Page or an Action, the Permissions determine what Menu Items the User can and cannot see.
    
    A Role is a set of Permissions.  Roles are assigned to Users.  Roles are hierarchical: a Role can have a parent Role; and if so it will inherit the Permissions of the parent Role, and all its parents.
    
    
    h2. Controllers and Actions
    
    To execute any Action, a user must have the appropriate Permission.  Therefore all Controllers and Actions you set up for your Rails application need to be entered here, otherwise no user will be able to execute them.
    
    You start by setting up the Controller and assigning it a Permission.  The Permission will be used as the default for any Actions invoked for that Controller.
    
    You have the option of setting up specific Actions for the Controllers.  You would want to do that if the Action were to appear as a Menu Item, or if it were to have a different level of security to the default for the Controller.
    
    
    h2. Content Pages
    
    Goldberg has a very simple CMS built in.  You can create pages to be displayed on the site, possibly in menu items.
    
    
    h2. Menu Editor
    
    Once you have set up your Controller Actions and Content Pages, you can put them into the site's menu using the Menu Editor.
    
    In the Menu Editor you can add and remove Menu Items and move them around.  The security of a Menu Item (whether the user can see it or not) depends on the Permission of the Action or Page attached to that Menu Item.
    
    h2. System Settings
    
    Go here to view and edit the settings that determine how Goldberg operates.

    	<p>You have the option of setting up specific Actions for the Controllers.  You would want to do that if the Action were to appear as a Menu Item, or if it were to have a different level of security to the default for the Controller.</p>
    
    
    	<h2>Content Pages</h2>
    
    	<p>Goldberg has a very simple <span class="caps">CMS</span> built in.  You can create pages to be displayed on the site, possibly in menu items.</p>
    
    
    	<h2>Menu Editor</h2>
    
    	<p>Once you have set up your Controller Actions and Content Pages, you can put them into the site&#8217;s menu using the Menu Editor.</p>
    
    
    	<p>In the Menu Editor you can add and remove Menu Items and move them around.  The security of a Menu Item (whether the user can see it or not) depends on the Permission of the Action or Page attached to that Menu Item.</p>

    <p>The HRWRP holds many annual events.&nbsp; You are invited to be part of all of them!</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#333399"><font color="#ff6600"><img height="134" width="200" align="right" src="/files/Image/party_in_park07.JPG" style="padding-left: 10px;" alt="" />Party in the Park</font> </font></strong>- Formerly called the Huff Run Fun Day, the Party in the Park is a partnership between Huff Run, the Mineral City Village Council and many other non profits in and around Mineral City. The event is held on the third Sunday in August at the Mineral City Park on State Route 800. The HRWRP puts up a huge tent under which we conduct extensive&nbsp; and fun environmental education and some fundraising. Craft vendors, music, kiddie tractor pulls, displays and many other activities are held throughout the day.</p>
    <p><a href="/5KFunMile"><strong><font color="#ff6600"><img height="150" width="200" align="left" src="/files/Image/5k08.JPG" style="padding-right: 10px;" alt="" />Huff Run Races</font></strong></a> - At the end of the Party in the Park, the HRWRP has held a 5K and a Fun Mile run/walk for the past few years as our major annual fundraiser. The 5K route passes Huff Run twice, our USGS gauge and the Farr Restoration Project.</p>
    <p><font color="#ff6600"><strong><img height="134" width="200" align="right" src="/files/Image/falltour05.JPG" style="padding-left: 10px;" alt="" />Fall Tour</strong> </font>- Alternating between weekday and weekend, we hold a tour of our restoration projects every year. We expect community members to attend weekend tours and those with professional interests to attend on weekdays but all are welcome. The tour usually encompasses four projects.</p>
    <p><a href="/photo_contest"><font color="#ff6600"><strong><img height="157" width="200" align="left" src="/files/Image/08wildflowerwinner.JPG" style="padding-right: 10px;" alt="" />Photo Contest</strong></font></a> - The Huff Run Photo Contest has been held since 2003. We only ask that you take your pictures within the watershed. The contest opens every spring and winners are announced at the Party in the Park.</p>
    <p><font color="#ff6600"><strong><img height="178" width="200" align="right" src="/files/Image/awarenessday07.JPG" style="" alt="" />Awareness Day</strong> </font>- Since its very beginning&nbsp; stages, the HRWRP's mission was to educate the community about water quality and has focused on children. Awareness Day field trips have been held since 1997 with classes coming from Bell Herron, Tusky Valley, Sandy Valley, Sherrodsville, home school groups and other area schools. The multiday event is always held in May with stations throughout the watershed that include fish collection, macroinvertebrate identification, restoration project tours, a water quality demonstration and enviroscape demonstrations. Our volunteers and partners make this program possible.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><a name="Jan">Jan</a>uary 19, 2010 meeting</h3>
    <p><u>In attendance:</u> Ed Taggart, Sandy Chenal, Melissa Thorne, Bo Hysong, Gary Alkire, Murv Burton, Marissa Geib, Maureen Wise, Jim Gue<br />
    Ed Taggart called the meeting to order at 5:35.<br />
    Maureen Wise presented the Treasurer&rsquo;s report as prepared by Belle Everett. OEEF grant funds were deposited totaling $2,707. Water bottle money was also deposited with a new balance of $13,883.36. Bo Hysong motioned to accept the minutes. Merv Burton seconded. Motion carried.<br />
    M. Wise also presented the December meeting minutes. Merv Burton motioned to accept them and Bo Hysong seconded. Motion carried. <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    OSM Award Video: Jim Gue showed a 15 minute video from the Office of Surface Mining Award Ceremony.<br />
    <u>Bottle Update:</u> Maureen gave an update that more than 30 water bottles had been sold and a total of $235 in donations were accepted from the Heat Huff Run mailing. A few members still need to give their money for bottles they are selling. <br />
    Sandy Chenal from Crossroads RC&amp;D told the group that the Mineral Zoar OSM grant is still open. The invoice was sent from ODNR but Crossroads is having problems accessing the funds from OSM. It will be closed shortly. She also invited everyone in the group to the Crossroads Annual meeting along with a regional RC&amp;D conference in April. <br />
    Sandy Township Zoning: Maureen told the group that the riparian setback zoning amendment that she has been working on with the Sandy Township Zoning Commission has been finally approved and is law!</p>
    <p><br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates:</u> Maureen gave an update about the Thomas project. It is 80% complete and still needs a rock channel, a sediment pond and its emergency spillway and risers installed. An extension was issued to allow work into 2010.<br />
    The Lyons Project design is 65% completed.<br />
    Pond A (June&rsquo;s Pond) on the Fern Hill project is ready to bid and should be under construction in June. The rights of entry have been signed. <br />
    We are still waiting on the right of entry for the Gob Pile at Belden to be signed. <br />
    The MWCD has still not made selections of their grant awardees. Maureen talked to their grant person and he said that he will be personally making phone calls on Feb. 19 to tell applicants if they were or were not awarded their grants. <br />
    <u>Bridge Painting and other volunteer opportunities</u>: Melissa told the group that she has been trying to recruit more volunteers through Tusky Valley High School since they now require students to do community service as part of their graduation requirements. We will invite them to ODOT clean ups, the Clean Sweep and Party in the Park. Dates were discussed for ODOT clean up days. Melissa also brought up the idea of painting the bridge on County Road 90.&nbsp; Students could help with this endeavor also. Many complications were brought up such as lead paint going into Huff Run and being handled. Melissa will call the County Engineer and see if they could scrap the old paint off or a different arrangement could be made as well as ask permission.<br />
    <u>Volunteer Banquet: </u>Melissa told the group that she and Maureen are throwing the idea around of having a banquet at the start of each year to thank volunteers and to give awards to make people feel welcome and thanked. The major drawback would be that volunteers would need to pay for their meal. The idea was discussed at length. It was agreed upon not to do a formal banquet but instead to do a potluck at the Mineral City Park Pavilion during the summer. <br />
    <u>EEC 2010:</u> Melissa Thorne reminded the group that they will be paying for Environmental Explorers programming in 2010 and 2011 with the funds made from the Herron Dance print raffle. A check will need to be written to keep some cash on hand for the program. Melissa also discussed having another fundraiser that involves the children. The kids had wanted to sell crafts and bake sale items. Another idea was brought up to do a car wash which would require very little to set up and hold. Melissa will talk to the EEC kids and let the Huff Run group know what they think. <br />
    <u>Participation Study</u>: An OSU grad student, Bradley Houser, contacted Maureen about the members of Huff Run being part of a study that he is conducting with many watershed groups throughout Ohio. The study hopes to understand why people participate in watershed groups. This study is a follow up and is very similar to a previous OSU thesis. Bradley will be contacting the members via email. <br />
    The MOU between Rural Action and Huff Run was discussed. Three items were added to Huff Run&rsquo;s end of the Understanding. It was agreed to and signed. <br />
    The Crossroads RC&amp;D Annual meeting was discussed. Four representatives will attend: Ed, Marissa, Maureen and Melissa. Marissa was intent on paying for herself but the HRWRP will pay for the other three tickets. Marissa motioned to buy the tickets. Bo seconded. Motion carried. <br />
    <br />
    Ed Taggart adjourned the meeting at 6:50pm. <br />
    Respectfully submitted by Maureen E. Wise, Coordinator.</p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%" />
    <h3><a name="Mar">March</a> 16, 2010 meeting minutes</h3>
    <p><u>In attendance: </u>Merv Burton, Jim Toms, Bo Hysong,&nbsp; Ed Taggart, John Slack, Bob Farnsworth, Maureen Wise, Susi Rankis, John Pirolozzi, Glenn Beatty, Linda Sims, Glenn Waggy, Ken Rink, Elizabeth Krahel, Cameron Krahel, Alan Walter, Joseph Ogonon, Ron Vetta, Joanne Vetta<br />
    <br />
    Ed Taggart called the meeting to order at 5:34pm.<br />
    Without a Treasurer's report, only an estimated record could be given. It was estimated that there was $14,235 in the account.<br />
    The January minutes were approved. Motioned by Hysong, seconded by Slack.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>5K</u> Wise told the group that the 5K date was set for Saturday August 14 at 9am. It had been discussed at past meetings if the Partnership should have it on a Saturday this year vs the traditional Sunday evening after the Party in the Park. Wise conducted an online survey of past participants. Unfortunately, only eight runners did it but their votes were split four to four. Because the February meeting was canceled, Taggart (president), Hysong (VP) and Wise made the call. Those present committed to volunteering that morning. They also agreed to again be part of the Tusky Valley Challenge.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Old Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project Update</u> Wise told the group that the Lyons Phase II project design is now at 90% complete. Jim Gue from ODNR obtained the Rights of Entry for both this project as well as for the bat tree removal of the Belden Gob Pile. Wise told the group of recent field work at HR-38 which will be the next project on the docket. Also, a Phase II at Fern Hill (June's pond) is still on schedule for a June construction. The Thomas Project is still not moving much. <br />
    The MWCD grant that was turned in during October that Wise was to hear back about originally in December and then in February has now been put off until March 19. <br />
    <u>Volunteer Dates </u>Wise reviewed dates provided by Melissa Thorne for ODOT Clean Up days, the Sandy Township Clean Sweep, Sandy Valley Tree Planting, Awareness Days, the 5k &amp; Fun Mile and Party in the Park. Some of those present signed up to help.<br />
    <u>SWIMS training hotel </u>Wise told the group that she is required to attend a training in Columbus on March 23 and 24 to learn a new reporting and timesheet program for Watershed Coordinators. There is very little mileage and no travel funds. She requested that the Partnership pay for a hotel stay for her. All agreed. Motioned by Hysong, seconded by Burton, all voted aye. <br />
    <u><br />
    Correspondence</u> Taggart presented many membership renewal notices. It was agreed to renew OMP for $25: motioned by Burton, seconded Beatty. It was agreed to renew Crossroads RC&amp;D for $50: motioned by Burton, seconded by Slack. It was agreed that the Nicole Donant library membership was too expensive at $100. It was agreed to support Courtney Oliver's race in Australia who had won the Huff Run 5K last year for $25: motioned Beatty, seconded Burton. <br />
    <br />
    Off agenda, it was also agreed to supply cash prizes for the 2010 Photo Contest at $50 for first, $35 for second and $25 for third. Motioned Slack, seconded Burton. <br />
    <br />
    Taggart closed the meeting at 6:10pm.<br />
    <br />
    Susi Rankis, Rural Action Sustainable Forestry Outreach and Education Associate, spoke about RA's new forest carbon trading program. This portion of the meeting adjourned at 7:30pm.</p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%" />
    <h3>&nbsp;<a name="Apr">April</a> 20, 2010</h3>
    <p>In attendance: Ed Taggart, Bo Hysong, Gary Alkire, Murv Burton, and Maureen Wise <br />
    (As there wasn&rsquo;t quorum, an official meeting could not be held. There were no motions.)</p>
    <p><br />
    Bo Hysong called the meeting to order at 5:35.<br />
    <br />
    Maureen Wise presented the Treasurer&rsquo;s report as prepared by Belle Everett.<br />
    <br />
    M. Wise also presented the March meeting minutes. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    <u>Bottle Update:</u> Maureen gave an update that more than 52 water bottles had been sold and a total of $252 in donations were accepted from the Heat Huff Run mailing. Members still need to give their money for 6 bottles they are selling. We still have 10 nice bottles to sell, but we also have 5 damaged ones that members decided would sell for $10 apiece. Two of the remaining bottles will be donated to our next AmeriCorps member and our summer intern. <br />
    <br />
    <u>Awareness Day Update:</u> Maureen distributed the awareness day sign-up sheet to find volunteers for our three upcoming Awareness Days. It was recommended to contact other members not present to see if they could help. The upcoming dates are May 7th, May 21st, and May 25th. <br />
    Tree Planting: We have two days coming up that will be devoted to planting trees on the Fern Hill Project. On April 29th and 30th, Sandy Valley 5th graders are going to come and plant around 1000 trees. The schedule for the day was distributed and the activities were discussed. Volunteers are needed and should contact Melissa Thorne.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates:</u> Maureen gave an update about the Thomas project. There is work being undertaken at the site again, and it should be completed shortly. An extension was issued to allow work into 2010.<br />
    Maureen plans to apply for a new OSM grant. It will fund work on the Lyons Project. <br />
    &nbsp;The MWCD has still not made selections of their grant awardees. Maureen talked to their grant person and he said that they will be notifying applicants by this Friday. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <u>Mile Restoration:</u> Valley Mining is in the process of doing mitigation work in response to stream impact they had. It is being proposed to them that they consider working on the last mile of Huff Run. The area being discussed is completely entrenched with AMD, it is a bad habitat and would benefit greatly from restoration work.<br />
    <br />
    <u>Interns/AmeriCorps:</u> There will be two summer interns in the office this year. Marissa Geib will be our ODNR intern, starting in May; Ariel VanNutter (a Kent State University student) will hold an unpaid internship, starting in June. Members agreed that we will not put an ad in the paper this year for the AmeriCorps position at Huff Run. A new AmeriCorps volunteer must be selected by July, and will start in August.<br />
    <u>Elections:</u> Huff Run will hold elections in June to elect Vice-President and Treasurer. <br />
    Clean Sweep: Huff Run will participate in the Sandy Township Clean Sweep, happening Saturday April 24th. We were directed to pick-up litter along Settlers Bottom Rd., Tunnel Hill Rd., and Mineral Zoar Rd. Vests and bags are provided, and lunch will be served to all volunteers at the Eagles in Sandyville. All volunteers interested are asked to meet at the Mineral City Park Pavilion at 9am on that Saturday. <br />
    <u>BIMCo:</u> Gary Alkire informed the group that Buckeye Industrial Mining Company (BIMCo) was bought by Rosebud Mining Co., which has 17 active mines in the area. <br />
    Correspondence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pens: We received an offer from a company to make promotional pens to advertise Huff Run. Members read over and discussed the opportunity and decided that we would not participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Thank-You:</u> We also received a thank-you from Courtney Oliver for supporting her trip to Australia. <br />

    <h3><a name="May">May</a> 18, 2010 meeting</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>In attendance:</u> Ed Taggart, Murv Burton, Belle Everett, Mark McNutt, Marissa Geib, and Maureen Wise (As there wasn&rsquo;t quorum, an official meeting could not be held. There were no motions)<br />
    Ed Taggart called the meeting to order at 5:46.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    The Treasurer&rsquo;s report was prepared and presented by Belle Everett. The starting balance was $13,155.79, with total additions being $442 from water bottle sales and donations; our expenses totaled $507 with fees and lunches for awareness days. Our ending balance came to $13,090, with $400 being in the Environmental Explorers Club and $1,979 remaining from the Ohio Environmental Education fund.<br />
    Marissa Geib discussed April&rsquo;s meeting minutes, and it was agreed upon that they were correct. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    <u>Interns:</u> Maureen reminded all members present that Huff Run will have 2 interns this summer; Marissa Geib will be our ODNR-funded intern full time, and Ariel VanNutter will be our unpaid intern starting in June. &nbsp;<br />
    <u>Bottle Update:</u> Marissa gave an update that more than 51 water bottles had been sold and a total of $765 in donations and sales have been made. A few members still need to give their money for bottles they are selling. We also have three damaged bottles that we are selling for a discounted price of $10, so show your support and buy a bottle while we still have them!<br />
    Awareness Day Update: We have had our first awareness day field trip, and it went very smoothly. All teachers commented how engaged the students were, and multiple students said how much they were enjoying the day. There will be two more days, May 21st and 25th. The next one will be small, with only Sherrodsville and homeschoolers attending on the 21st. Any and all volunteers are asked to arrive at the office by 8:30 am to prepare and get maps. Lets make these next two as good as the first!<br />
    <u>Tree Planting: </u>The tree planting days were a great success, with 120 Sandy Valley 5th graders planting 730 in only 1 &frac12; hours! They were so efficient that we held an impromptu &ldquo;mini awareness day&rdquo; the second day we were scheduled for planting as there was no more trees to plant!&nbsp; It was very helpful and fun to have so many willing helpers, and the Repository coved it in a good (although a bit inaccurate) article the next day. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates</u>: Maureen gave an update about the status of many projects. The HR42 project will be up for bid next week, and the plans for Lyons will be done in a month or so. On May 26th Belden is scheduled to receive slag buffers, and it is also expected to be retrofitted shortly to stem a flow of water. At Mineral-Zoar, we are not sure where from but there is an upwelling of water coming into the wetland and bypassing the RAPS system. Thomas is just about done, with seeding and mulching being the only thing left to be done. On the grant side, Huff Run was denied for the Muskingham Watershed Conservancy District Grant. Maureen is currently working on writing an OSM grant to fund Lyons stage II. We have a $500 limit for our newsletter next year, and we will discuss our deficit next meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>Party in the Park:</u>&nbsp; Party in the Park is fast approaching, with the community event being held on August 15th and our 5K on the Saturday before, August 14th. We discussed the idea of selling the AMD tie-dye t-shirts, or at least asking for a donation. Also, the problem of getting hot water at the Park was brought up. The members decided that a good solution to this issue would be the use of a turkey fryer to heat up large amounts of water quickly. Maureen will be contacting members to see if anyone has a turkey fryer we could use, or we could possibly even purchase one. The 5K flyers are printed and will be mailed shortly.<br />
    <u>Fundraising:</u> Marissa addressed the members with her current project of procuring a kayak or canoe to use as a raffle item to benefit Huff Run. The money raised would be used to cover our deficit, with members being asked to sell the $2 tickets (or 6 for $10). The drawing would be around Party in the Park, if not on the day of, and we are hoping to raise a decent amount of money with this. More information is coming, and as soon as she finds a kayak the raffle will get underway.<br />
    <u>Thrivant Financial:</u>&nbsp; An opportunity was presented by a member to Maureen to possibly obtain funds through Thrivant Financial for Lutherans. The organizations matches 3:1 of the total amount we would raise through a fundraiser back to us, as long as we could have 6 families that belong to Thrivant Financial active in the fundraiser. We discussed having the whole weekend, the 5K and the profits from Party in the Park and the Kayak raffle, count as our fundraiser. More information will follow. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br />
    &nbsp;We received two thank-you&rsquo;s, one from Crossroads RC&amp;D for becoming a 2010 member, and one from NRCS for being part of their tour earlier in the year. We also received the OSM newsletter.<br />
    President Ed Taggart and Coordinator Maureen Wise attended the OMP meeting, and both agreed it went well. The SEOWC provided lunch. <br />
    <br />
    Ed Taggart adjourned the meeting at 6:49pm. <br />

    <br />
    Belle Everett presented the Treasurer&rsquo;s report, stating that after paying bills owed from Awareness Days the total left from the OEEF grant is $188. With a generous $200 donation from PSC Metals to purchase a kayak, our total balance for the general fund came to $11, 914.61. Bo Hysong motioned to accept the report, and Merv Burton seconded. The vote passed unanimous.<br />
    <br />
    Marissa Geib recalled last meetings minutes, and they were discussed briefly. Belle motioned to accept them, and Merv seconded that. The vote passed unanimous. <br />

    <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    <u>Party in the Park: </u>Maureen gave an update on Party in the Park. Marissa and her are currently seeking new business sponsorships. We will be giving away Eco-friendly tote bags instead of t-shirts this year also. The flyers are made and have been mailed/handed out. It was also discussed and decided that the AMD tie-dye T-shirts will cost $2 this year, to cover cost of materials. We have located 2 turkey fryers to use for the purpose of heating water for the AMD tie dying. It is coming quick, so members please start preparing to volunteer at least one of the two days!<br />
    <u><br />
    Kayak Raffle:</u> With a generous $200 donation from PSC Metals of Canton South, we were able to purchase a yellow Potomac 100ES Kayak and matching paddle from Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods in Canton. We will be raffling off the Kayak at Party in the Park, but we are selling tickets now! They are $2 each or 6 (a pack) for $10. It is a beautiful sit-in Kayak with a UV-protecting finish, molded seat with a padded backrest, and a matching paddle ($50 value-thank you Dick&rsquo;s!). Stop in the office to see it and pick up a pack of tickets to sell or buy, or purchase online at www.huffrun.org/kayak<br />
    <br />
    <u>AmeriCorps Hiring:</u> Huff Run has interviewed 2 applicants so far, and are excited to share that they did offer the position to a young women from Michigan with a masters in Geology. She seems like the ideal applicant, and they are waiting for her reply. However, the other applicant was also extremely skilled so either would be a great addition to the Huff Run team in 2010-2011.</p>
    <p><u>2010 Deficit:</u> With the latest calculations from Rural Action&rsquo;s financial department, the 2010 deficit for Huff Run is now $3,460. This is a big decrease from the initial estimate of over $8,000! Keep in mind, this new budget only allows for a $500 budget for newsletters, whose budget is currently over $3,000. We discussed limiting the mailings down, and also creating a strictly email newsletter. Maureen will update the group at the next meeting with costs and decisions. <br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates:</u> Maureen was excited to give an update about the Thomas project; it is completed! Another project, The Belden Slag addition, is completed and 13 tons of steel slag was dumped at the Belden project. Both June&rsquo;s Pond and Belden Gob is in the bidding stage, with both being designed and paid for by ODNR. At Mineral-Zoar drilling is being completed to find the source of mine water entering the wetland without going through the RAPS system. The Lyons Phase II project is still being designed and is expected to have solid plans soon. Maureen is also working on a grant for funding of the Lyons Phase II project from OSM. She, along with Melissa and Marissa, met with the Development Coordinator for MWCD. Maureen will apply again with the District in the fall. Huff Run was invited by Kathy Smith, a member, to apply for funding from Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, where she works. They match any fundraising at a 3:1 rate. Our entire Party in the Park weekend including the 5K, kayak raffle and shirt sales would all be included. Finally, Maureen is in contact with Mineral City Mayor Rick Cain to begin working on a grant to receive a wind-power plant preliminary study here in town. <br />
    <br />
    <u>Environmental Explorers Club</u>: Melissa gave an update on the activities of the EEC kids, with a field trip scheduled for this weekend and another in July. She and the children have discussed the idea of a car wash as a possible fundraiser. They are in the process of acquiring permission to hold the car wash at another place except for at the Huff Run office, but are hoping to hold it either July 10th or 24th. <br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <u>Floor Painting:</u> Vice-President Bo gave a short report on a small improvement project for the Huff Run office. 4 Gallons of floor paint were given to Huff Run by the Mineral City Village Council in exchange for us providing the labor to paint the floor. Bo stressed that this would not be a simple task, and we would need to acquire special tools to even. Members present discussed that they would like to help, and whenever we are ready to undertake the task all members will be contacted. <br />

    <strong>Correspondence</strong>: President Ed Taggart received an OSM newsletter.&nbsp; <br />

    Ed Taggart called the meeting to order at 5:35.<br />
    Maureen Wise presented the Treasurer&rsquo;s report as prepared by Belle Everett. OEEF grant funds were deposited totaling $2,707. Water bottle money was also deposited with a new balance of $13,883.36. Bo Hysong motioned to accept the minutes. Merv Burton seconded. Motion carried.<br />
    M. Wise also presented the December meeting minutes. Merv Burton motioned to accept them and Bo Hysong seconded. Motion carried. <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    OSM Award Video: Jim Gue showed a 15 minute video from the Office of Surface Mining Award Ceremony.<br />
    <u>Bottle Update:</u> Maureen gave an update that more than 30 water bottles had been sold and a total of $235 in donations were accepted from the Heat Huff Run mailing. A few members still need to give their money for bottles they are selling. <br />
    Sandy Chenal from Crossroads RC&amp;D told the group that the Mineral Zoar OSM grant is still open. The invoice was sent from ODNR but Crossroads is having problems accessing the funds from OSM. It will be closed shortly. She also invited everyone in the group to the Crossroads Annual meeting along with a regional RC&amp;D conference in April. <br />
    Sandy Township Zoning: Maureen told the group that the riparian setback zoning amendment that she has been working on with the Sandy Township Zoning Commission has been finally approved and is law!</p>
    <p><br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates:</u> Maureen gave an update about the Thomas project. It is 80% complete and still needs a rock channel, a sediment pond and its emergency spillway and risers installed. An extension was issued to allow work into 2010.<br />
    The Lyons Project design is 65% completed.<br />
    Pond A (June&rsquo;s Pond) on the Fern Hill project is ready to bid and should be under construction in June. The rights of entry have been signed. <br />
    We are still waiting on the right of entry for the Gob Pile at Belden to be signed. <br />
    The MWCD has still not made selections of their grant awardees. Maureen talked to their grant person and he said that he will be personally making phone calls on Feb. 19 to tell applicants if they were or were not awarded their grants. <br />
    <u>Bridge Painting and other volunteer opportunities</u>: Melissa told the group that she has been trying to recruit more volunteers through Tusky Valley High School since they now require students to do community service as part of their graduation requirements. We will invite them to ODOT clean ups, the Clean Sweep and Party in the Park. Dates were discussed for ODOT clean up days. Melissa also brought up the idea of painting the bridge on County Road 90.&nbsp; Students could help with this endeavor also. Many complications were brought up such as lead paint going into Huff Run and being handled. Melissa will call the County Engineer and see if they could scrap the old paint off or a different arrangement could be made as well as ask permission.<br />
    <u>Volunteer Banquet: </u>Melissa told the group that she and Maureen are throwing the idea around of having a banquet at the start of each year to thank volunteers and to give awards to make people feel welcome and thanked. The major drawback would be that volunteers would need to pay for their meal. The idea was discussed at length. It was agreed upon not to do a formal banquet but instead to do a potluck at the Mineral City Park Pavilion during the summer. <br />
    <u>EEC 2010:</u> Melissa Thorne reminded the group that they will be paying for Environmental Explorers programming in 2010 and 2011 with the funds made from the Herron Dance print raffle. A check will need to be written to keep some cash on hand for the program. Melissa also discussed having another fundraiser that involves the children. The kids had wanted to sell crafts and bake sale items. Another idea was brought up to do a car wash which would require very little to set up and hold. Melissa will talk to the EEC kids and let the Huff Run group know what they think. <br />
    <u>Participation Study</u>: An OSU grad student, Bradley Houser, contacted Maureen about the members of Huff Run being part of a study that he is conducting with many watershed groups throughout Ohio. The study hopes to understand why people participate in watershed groups. This study is a follow up and is very similar to a previous OSU thesis. Bradley will be contacting the members via email. <br />
    The MOU between Rural Action and Huff Run was discussed. Three items were added to Huff Run&rsquo;s end of the Understanding. It was agreed to and signed. <br />
    The Crossroads RC&amp;D Annual meeting was discussed. Four representatives will attend: Ed, Marissa, Maureen and Melissa. Marissa was intent on paying for herself but the HRWRP will pay for the other three tickets. Marissa motioned to buy the tickets. Bo seconded. Motion carried. <br />
    <br />
    Ed Taggart adjourned the meeting at 6:50pm. <br />

    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>5K</u> Wise told the group that the 5K date was set for Saturday August 14 at 9am. It had been discussed at past meetings if the Partnership should have it on a Saturday this year vs the traditional Sunday evening after the Party in the Park. Wise conducted an online survey of past participants. Unfortunately, only eight runners did it but their votes were split four to four. Because the February meeting was canceled, Taggart (president), Hysong (VP) and Wise made the call. Those present committed to volunteering that morning. They also agreed to again be part of the Tusky Valley Challenge.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Old Business</strong><br />

Jim Gue from ODNR obtained the Rights of Entry for both this project as well as for the bat tree removal of the Belden Gob Pile. Wise told the group of recent field work at HR-38 which will be the next project on the docket. Also, a Phase II at Fern Hill (June's pond) is still on schedule for a June construction. The Thomas Project is still not moving much. <br />
    The MWCD grant that was turned in during October that Wise was to hear back about originally in December and then in February has now been put off until March 19. <br />

    <u>SWIMS training hotel </u>Wise told the group that she is required to attend a training in Columbus on March 23 and 24 to learn a new reporting and timesheet program for Watershed Coordinators. There is very little mileage and no travel funds. She requested that the Partnership pay for a hotel stay for her. All agreed. Motioned by Hysong, seconded by Burton, all voted aye. <br />
    <u><br />
    Correspondence</u> Taggart presented many membership renewal notices. It was agreed to renew OMP for $25: motioned by Burton, seconded Beatty.

    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    <u>Bottle Update:</u> Maureen gave an update that more than 52 water bottles had been sold and a total of $252 in donations were accepted from the Heat Huff Run mailing. Members still need to give their money for 6 bottles they are selling. We still have 10 nice bottles to sell, but we also have 5 damaged ones that members decided would sell for $10 apiece. Two of the remaining bottles will be donated to our next AmeriCorps member and our summer intern. <br />
    <br />
    <u>Awareness Day Update:</u> Maureen distributed the awareness day sign-up sheet to find volunteers for our three upcoming Awareness Days. It was recommended to contact other members not present to see if they could help. The upcoming dates are May 7th, May 21st, and May 25th. <br />

    &nbsp;The MWCD has still not made selections of their grant awardees. Maureen talked to their grant person and he said that they will be notifying applicants by this Friday. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <u>Mile Restoration:</u> Valley Mining is in the process of doing mitigation work in response to stream impact they had. It is being proposed to them that they consider working on the last mile of Huff Run. The area being discussed is completely entrenched with AMD, it is a bad habitat and would benefit greatly from restoration work.<br />
    <br />
    <u>Interns/AmeriCorps:</u> There will be two summer interns in the office this year. Marissa Geib will be our ODNR intern, starting in May; Ariel VanNutter (a Kent State University student) will hold an unpaid internship, starting in June.

    <h3><a name="May">May</a> 18, 2010 meeting</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>In attendance:</u> Ed Taggart, Murv Burton, Belle Everett, Mark McNutt, Marissa Geib, and Maureen Wise (As there wasn&rsquo;t quorum, an official meeting could not be held. There were no motions)<br />
    Ed Taggart called the meeting to order at 5:46.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    The Treasurer&rsquo;s report was prepared and presented by Belle Everett. The starting balance was $13,155.79, with total additions being $442 from water bottle sales and donations; our expenses totaled $507 with fees and lunches for awareness days. Our ending balance came to $13,090, with $400 being in the Environmental Explorers Club and $1,979 remaining from the Ohio Environmental Education fund.<br />
    Marissa Geib discussed April&rsquo;s meeting minutes, and it was agreed upon that they were correct. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    <u>Interns:</u> Maureen reminded all members present that Huff Run will have 2 interns this summer; Marissa Geib will be our ODNR-funded intern full time, and Ariel VanNutter will be our unpaid intern starting in June. &nbsp;<br />
    <u>Bottle Update:</u> Marissa gave an update that more than 51 water bottles had been sold and a total of $765 in donations and sales have been made. A few members still need to give their money for bottles they are selling. We also have three damaged bottles that we are selling for a discounted price of $10, so show your support and buy a bottle while we still have them!<br />
    Awareness Day Update: We have had our first awareness day field trip, and it went very smoothly. All teachers commented how engaged the students were, and multiple students said how much they were enjoying the day. There will be two more days, May 21st and 25th. The next one will be small, with only Sherrodsville and homeschoolers attending on the 21st. Any and all volunteers are asked to arrive at the office by 8:30 am to prepare and get maps. Lets make these next two as good as the first!<br />
    <u>Tree Planting: </u>The tree planting days were a great success, with 120 Sandy Valley 5th graders planting 730 in only 1 &frac12; hours! They were so efficient that we held an impromptu &ldquo;mini awareness day&rdquo; the second day we were scheduled for planting as there was no more trees to plant!&nbsp; It was very helpful and fun to have so many willing helpers, and the Repository coved it in a good (although a bit inaccurate) article the next day. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates</u>: Maureen gave an update about the status of many projects. The HR42 project will be up for bid next week, and the plans for Lyons will be done in a month or so. On May 26th Belden is scheduled to receive slag buffers, and it is also expected to be retrofitted shortly to stem a flow of water. At Mineral-Zoar, we are not sure where from but there is an upwelling of water coming into the wetland and bypassing the RAPS system. Thomas is just about done, with seeding and mulching being the only thing left to be done. On the grant side, Huff Run was denied for the Muskingham Watershed Conservancy District Grant. Maureen is currently working on writing an OSM grant to fund Lyons stage II. We have a $500 limit for our newsletter next year, and we will discuss our deficit next meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>Party in the Park:</u>&nbsp; Party in the Park is fast approaching, with the community event being held on August 15th and our 5K on the Saturday before, August 14th. We discussed the idea of selling the AMD tie-dye t-shirts, or at least asking for a donation. Also, the problem of getting hot water at the Park was brought up. The members decided that a good solution to this issue would be the use of a turkey fryer to heat up large amounts of water quickly. Maureen will be contacting members to see if anyone has a turkey fryer we could use, or we could possibly even purchase one. The 5K flyers are printed and will be mailed shortly.<br />
    <u>Fundraising:</u> Marissa addressed the members with her current project of procuring a kayak or canoe to use as a raffle item to benefit Huff Run. The money raised would be used to cover our deficit, with members being asked to sell the $2 tickets (or 6 for $10). The drawing would be around Party in the Park, if not on the day of, and we are hoping to raise a decent amount of money with this. More information is coming, and as soon as she finds a kayak the raffle will get underway.<br />
    <u>Thrivant Financial:</u>&nbsp; An opportunity was presented by a member to Maureen to possibly obtain funds through Thrivant Financial for Lutherans. The organizations matches 3:1 of the total amount we would raise through a fundraiser back to us, as long as we could have 6 families that belong to Thrivant Financial active in the fundraiser. We discussed having the whole weekend, the 5K and the profits from Party in the Park and the Kayak raffle, count as our fundraiser. More information will follow. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br />
    &nbsp;We received two thank-you&rsquo;s, one from Crossroads RC&amp;D for becoming a 2010 member, and one from NRCS for being part of their tour earlier in the year. We also received the OSM newsletter.<br />
    President Ed Taggart and Coordinator Maureen Wise attended the OMP meeting, and both agreed it went well. The SEOWC provided lunch. <br />
    <br />
    Ed Taggart adjourned the meeting at 6:49pm. <br />

    <p><u>In attendance</u>: Ed Taggart, Bo Hysong, Gary Alkire, Murv Burton, Maureen Wise, Belle Everett, Marissa Geib, and Melissa Thorne<br />
    Ed Taggart called the meeting to order at 5:45.<br />
    <br />
    Belle Everett presented the Treasurer&rsquo;s report, stating that after paying bills owed from Awareness Days the total left from the OEEF grant is $188. With a generous $200 donation from PSC Metals to purchase a kayak, our total balance for the general fund came to $11, 914.61. Bo Hysong motioned to accept the report, and Merv Burton seconded. The vote passed unanimous.<br />
    <br />
    Marissa Geib recalled last meetings minutes, and they were discussed briefly. Belle motioned to accept them, and Merv seconded that. The vote passed unanimous. <br />
    <br />
    <u>Nominations</u> were heard for the offices of Treasurer and Vice-President with terms being 2 years in duration. Belle Everett was nominated for the position she currently holds, and with a unanimous vote she was re-elected. Bo Hysong was nominated for the position he currently holds, and with a unanimous vote he was re-elected. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Old Business </strong><br />
    <u>Party in the Park: </u>Maureen gave an update on Party in the Park. Marissa and her are currently seeking new business sponsorships. We will be giving away Eco-friendly tote bags instead of t-shirts this year also. The flyers are made and have been mailed/handed out. It was also discussed and decided that the AMD tie-dye T-shirts will cost $2 this year, to cover cost of materials. We have located 2 turkey fryers to use for the purpose of heating water for the AMD tie dying. It is coming quick, so members please start preparing to volunteer at least one of the two days!<br />
    <u><br />
    Kayak Raffle:</u> With a generous $200 donation from PSC Metals of Canton South, we were able to purchase a yellow Potomac 100ES Kayak and matching paddle from Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods in Canton. We will be raffling off the Kayak at Party in the Park, but we are selling tickets now! They are $2 each or 6 (a pack) for $10. It is a beautiful sit-in Kayak with a UV-protecting finish, molded seat with a padded backrest, and a matching paddle ($50 value-thank you Dick&rsquo;s!). Stop in the office to see it and pick up a pack of tickets to sell or buy, or purchase online at www.huffrun.org/kayak<br />
    <br />
    <u>AmeriCorps Hiring:</u> Huff Run has interviewed 2 applicants so far, and are excited to share that they did offer the position to a young women from Michigan with a masters in Geology. She seems like the ideal applicant, and they are waiting for her reply. However, the other applicant was also extremely skilled so either would be a great addition to the Huff Run team in 2010-2011.</p>
    <p><u>2010 Deficit:</u> With the latest calculations from Rural Action&rsquo;s financial department, the 2010 deficit for Huff Run is now $3,460. This is a big decrease from the initial estimate of over $8,000! Keep in mind, this new budget only allows for a $500 budget for newsletters, whose budget is currently over $3,000. We discussed limiting the mailings down, and also creating a strictly email newsletter. Maureen will update the group at the next meeting with costs and decisions. <br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <strong>New Business</strong><br />
    <u>Project/ Grant Updates:</u> Maureen was excited to give an update about the Thomas project; it is completed! Another project, The Belden Slag addition, is completed and 13 tons of steel slag was dumped at the Belden project. Both June&rsquo;s Pond and Belden Gob is in the bidding stage, with both being designed and paid for by ODNR. At Mineral-Zoar drilling is being completed to find the source of mine water entering the wetland without going through the RAPS system. The Lyons Phase II project is still being designed and is expected to have solid plans soon. Maureen is also working on a grant for funding of the Lyons Phase II project from OSM. She, along with Melissa and Marissa, met with the Development Coordinator for MWCD. Maureen will apply again with the District in the fall. Huff Run was invited by Kathy Smith, a member, to apply for funding from Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, where she works. They match any fundraising at a 3:1 rate. Our entire Party in the Park weekend including the 5K, kayak raffle and shirt sales would all be included. Finally, Maureen is in contact with Mineral City Mayor Rick Cain to begin working on a grant to receive a wind-power plant preliminary study here in town. <br />
    <br />
    <u>Environmental Explorers Club</u>: Melissa gave an update on the activities of the EEC kids, with a field trip scheduled for this weekend and another in July. She and the children have discussed the idea of a car wash as a possible fundraiser. They are in the process of acquiring permission to hold the car wash at another place except for at the Huff Run office, but are hoping to hold it either July 10th or 24th. <br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <u>Floor Painting:</u> Vice-President Bo gave a short report on a small improvement project for the Huff Run office. 4 Gallons of floor paint were given to Huff Run by the Mineral City Village Council in exchange for us providing the labor to paint the floor. Bo stressed that this would not be a simple task, and we would need to acquire special tools to even. Members present discussed that they would like to help, and whenever we are ready to undertake the task all members will be contacted. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Correspondence</strong>: President Ed Taggart received an OSM newsletter.&nbsp; <br />

    <h2><font color="#000080">Riparian Buffers</font></h2>
    <p><img height="150" width="200" align="right" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px;" src="/files/Image/trees.JPG" />A strong riparian buffer provides an important transition zone between the water and adjacent uplands. These zones&nbsp; should have a diverse population of plant species. They are very important to stream  ecosystems. Riparian buffers serve as a food source for stream life by dropping leaf litter, humus and woody debris (sticks, branches). Macroinvertebrates use the litter for food and housing as well. Branches make hiding places for fish. The shade that a strong forested corridor provides is also extremely important. It lowers the water temperature of the stream which gives the water a higher capacity to carry oxygen. Not only do fish appreciate the added oxygen, but they also are intolerant to certain warmer temperatures. The strong, deep roots in trees and brush stabilize stream banks against erosion much better than grasses. Erosion from stream banks not only silts up the stream (depleting the homes of macroinvertebrates which live between and under rocks) but also unnaturally changes the stream channel, harming the entire ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Riparian zones are called buffers for a reason. They work as buffers against surface run off that can carry non point source pollution (<a href="/amd">acid mine drainage</a>, road run off, pesticides, animal waste etc). The vegetation in the buffer zone slows the flow of surface runoff and allows it to percolate through the soil. Surface runoff is inversely proportional to the density of vegetation present. Leaf litter and humus dropped on the ground add to the ability of other vegetation to slow runoff. This results in a more gradual release of water from the watershed and stabilizes the watercourses and the ecosystem.

    <h2><font color="#000080">Riparian Buffers</font></h2>
    <p><img height="150" width="200" align="right" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px;" src="/files/Image/trees.JPG" />A strong riparian buffer provides an important transition zone between the water and adjacent uplands. These zones&nbsp; should have a diverse population of plant species. They are very important to stream  ecosystems. Riparian buffers serve as a food source for stream life by dropping leaf litter, humus and woody debris (sticks, branches). Macroinvertebrates use the litter for food and housing as well. Branches make hiding places for fish. The shade that a strong forested corridor provides is also extremely important. It lowers the water temperature of the stream which gives the water a higher capacity to carry oxygen. Not only do fish appreciate the added oxygen, but they also are intolerant to certain warmer temperatures. The strong, deep roots in trees and brush stabilize stream banks against erosion much better than grasses. Erosion from stream banks not only silts up the stream (depleting the homes of macroinvertebrates which live between and under rocks) but also unnaturally changes the stream channel, harming the entire ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Riparian zones are called buffers for a reason. They work as buffers against surface run off that can carry non point source pollution (<a href="/amd">acid mine drainage</a>, road run off, pesticides, animal waste etc). The vegetation in the buffer zone slows the flow of surface runoff and allows it to percolate through the soil. Surface runoff is inversely proportional to the density of vegetation present. Leaf litter and humus dropped on the ground add to the ability of other vegetation to slow runoff. This results in a more gradual release of water from the watershed and stabilizes the watercourses and the ecosystem. When warm water from roads or surface water enters a cool water stream, this changes the equilibrium in the stream and can have a detrimental affect on aquatic life.</p>
    <p>The buffers also serve many functions critical to wildlife habitat by providing food, cover, travel, escape routes, roosting sites, nesting areas and den areas for land dwelling wildlife.</p>
    <p>In addition to helping wildlife and stream quality, buffers along streamside lots can benefit homeowners as well. While the vegetation is buffering the stream against pollutants, it soaks up water reducing flooding events.</p>
